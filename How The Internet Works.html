        <p style = "background-color:#d0dceb; font-size:16px"> The Internet is a network of interconnected systems that allows data to be sent around the globe. It functions by exchanging data in tiny packets through the use of routers which send the data to the proper location. Every device that is connected to the Internet has a distinct IP address that enables precise data transmission and reception. In order to help your device find the server where the website is hosted, the Domain Name System (DNS) converts the human-readable address that you type (www.example.com) into an IP address. You can access web pages, images, videos and other online content by using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to exchange data back and forth after it has been located. </p>
