        <p style = "background-color:SteelBlue; font-size:16px"> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the Domain Name System are very important systems that enbale the Internet to function properly.</p>
        <h2>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol?</h2>
        <p style = "background-color:SteelBlue; font-size:16px"> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol that manages how data is transferred across the Internet. It enables users to access web pages, images, videos, and other content by sending requests and receiving responses. Without HTTP, easy communication and the sharing of resources across the web would not be possible.</p>
        <h2> What is the Domain Name System?</h2>
        <p style = "background-color:SteelBlue; font-size:16px">The Domain Name System translates readable domain names like www. example.com into IP addresses. Computers use this to identify and locate each other in the network. This system makes it easier for people to access websites without needing to remember long strings of numbers.</p>
