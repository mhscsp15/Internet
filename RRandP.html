        <p style = "background-color:#d0dceb; font-size:16px">Routers, Redundancy, and Packets are essential for the Internet to function smoothly and reliably.</p>
        <h2> What are Routers?</h2>
        <p style = "background-color:#d0dceb; font-size:16px">Routers are devices that manage and control the direction of data between networks. They ensure information such as messages and files are sent to the right destination by determining the best path for the data to travel. It allows for easy communication between devices.</p>
        <h2> What is Redundancy?</h2>
        <p style = "background-color:#d0dceb; font-size:16px">Redundancy is the use of back up paths in a network to ensure that in case of a failure in a particular part, the network will continue to work. It prevents any interuptions in service from occurring.</p>
        <h2> What are Packets?</h2>
        <p style = "background-color:#d0dceb; font-size:16px">Packets are small units of data that have been broken down from larger files. Every packet is transmitted and received individually. Then, it is rebuilt into the original file at the destination. It allows for faster and flexible transmission.</p>
